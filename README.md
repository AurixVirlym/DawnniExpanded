## DawnniExpanded v1.2.2
This is a content expansion mod for the game Dawnsbury Days, it adds a random collection of items, spells and features that I felt a particular desire to add.

If there's any problem with the mod, feel free to contact on Discord. @comradedanni.

## It currently includes:
- A universal Leap action for characters.
- 6 New Spells (Horizon Thunder Sphere, Animated Assault, Scorching Ray, False Life, Rousing Splash and Endure)
- 3 New Feats (Dueling Parry, Battle Medicine and Powerful Leap)
- 8 Archetype Dedication (Fighter, Ranger, Rogue, Barbarian, Monk, Medic, Sentinel and Duelist)
- 13 Archetype Feats, including Basic feats to take feat from other classes.
- 5 Mutagens (Energy, Drakeheart, Serene, Juggarnaut and Bestial) in both lesser and moderate versions.
- Homebrew Staves of Spell Potency, 1 handed weapons which grant a bonus to spell attack rolls and DCs.
- Heightened Scrolls up to 4th for any base game scroll which had a built in Heightened +1 effect (And 3rd level Fear).
- Heightened Scrolls up to 4th for any spell from this mod.

Every new feature has been given the **DawnniEx** Trait and any feature that is not in the standard Pathfinder 2e rules has addtionally been marked with the **Homebrew** Trait.

## Installation
To install DawnniExpanded:
1. Download the lastest zip file from [Releases](https://github.com/AurixVirlym/Dawnsbury.Mods.DawnniExpanded/releases) or subscribe to the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3163146733) page.
2. Then extract the zip file in /Dawnsbury Days/CustomMods. If using the Steam Workshop, you will be asked to confirm that you wish to Code Mods which DawnniExpanded.
3. Launch the game!

## Differences from Tabletop
- Leap Action only provokes at start of movement.
- Endure lasts an entire encounter and has been reduced to 4 temp HP per spell level.
- Serene Mutagen gives a flat damage reduction rather than scaling with number of damage dice.
