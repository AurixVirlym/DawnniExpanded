## DawnniExpanded v 1.0.0
This is a content expansion mod for the game Dawnsbury Days, it adds a random collection of items, spells and features that I felt a particular desire to add.

If there's any problem with the mod, feel free to contact on Discord. @comradedanni.

## It currently includes:
- A univerial Leap action for characters.
- 2 New Spells (Animated Assasult and Scorching Ray)
- 2 New Feats (Battle Medicine and Powerful Leap)
- 5 Mutagens (Energy, Drakeheart, Serene, Juggarnaut and Bestial) in both lesser and moderate versions.
- Homebrew Staves of Spell Potency, which grant a bonus to spell attack rolls and DCs.

Every new feature has been given the **DawnniEx** Trait and any feature that is not in the standard Pathfinder 2e rules has addtionally been marked with the **Homebrew** Trait.
