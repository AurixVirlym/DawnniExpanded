## DawnniExpanded v1.2.5
This is a content expansion mod for the game Dawnsbury Days, it adds a random collection of items, spells and features that I felt a particular desire to add.

If there's any problem with the mod, feel free to contact on Discord. @comradedanni.

## It currently includes:
- The **Bard** class, with Maestro and Warrior Muses along with Inspire Courage, Triple Time, A homebrewed version of Counter Performance, Hymn of Healing and Lingering Composition Metamagic.
- A universal Leap action for characters.
- 7 New Spells for spell lists, Horizon Thunder Sphere, Animated Assault, Scorching Ray, False Life, Rousing Splash, Endure and Sudden Bolt (Full Credit for Sudden Bolt to Jacob Dehkordi "beets")
- 3 New Feats (Dueling Parry, Battle Medicine and Powerful Leap)
- 8 Archetype Dedication (Fighter, Ranger, Rogue, Barbarian, Monk, Medic, Sentinel and Duelist)
- 13 Archetype Feats, including Basic feats to take feat from other classes.
- 5 Mutagens (Energy, Drakeheart, Serene, Juggarnaut and Bestial) in both lesser and moderate versions.
- Homebrew Staves of Spell Potency, 1 handed weapons which grant a bonus to spell attack rolls and DCs.
- Heightened Scrolls up to 4th for any base game scroll which had a built in Heightened +1 effect (And 3rd level Fear).
- Heightened Scrolls for any spell from this mod.
.

Every new feature has been given the **DawnniEx** Trait and any feature that is not in the standard Pathfinder 2e rules has additionally been marked with the **Homebrew** Trait.

## Installation
To install DawnniExpanded:
1. Subscribe to the Steam Workshop of this DawnniExpanded.
2. When launching the you will be asked to confirm that if you wish to load Code Mods use which DawnniExpanded is, so allow it!!!
3. Launch the game!

## Differences from Tabletop
- Leap Action only provokes at start of movement.
- Endure lasts an entire encounter and has been reduced to 4 temp HP per spell level.
- Serene Mutagen gives a flat damage reduction rather than scaling with number of damage dice.

## Thanks
Jacob Dehkordi (beets) for allowing me to incorporate their Sudden Bolt spell into this mod.

Special thanks to Petr Hudeƒçek for listening to my ramblings on the Dawnsbury Days Discord and being the main developer and to everyone who contributed to the game.
